# credit-score-classification-using-machine-learning
There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:

Good
Standard
Poor


Here we have followed the following steps:
Importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset.
Have a look at the information about the columns in the dataset.
Have a look if the dataset has any null values or not.
Data Exploration
Exploring the occupation feature to know if the occupation of the person affects credit scores.
Explore whether the Annual Income of the person impacts the credit scores or not.
Explore whether the monthly in-hand salary impacts credit scores or not.
Having more bank accounts impacts credit scores or not.
The impact on credit scores based on the number of credit cards.
The impact on credit scores based on the average interest on loans and EMIs.
Credit Score Classification Model
Transform Credit_Mix column into a numerical feature so that we can use it to train a Machine Learning model for the task of credit score classification.
Split the data into features and labels by selecting the features we found important for our model.
Split the data into training and test sets and proceed further by training a credit score classification model.
Make predictions from the model by giving inputs to the model according to the features used to train the model.
